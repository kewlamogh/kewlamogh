# @kewlamogh
Hey there! My name is Amogh and I am a web developer. My tech stack is what I call *mern* - MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS. I am a former mobile developer with Kotlin, and am learning Golang + `net/http`. Some of my projects you can contribute to:
* BobAssistant - my take on a virtual assistant that doesn't track you
* zomb-apocolypse - a top down shooter, misspelled on purpose

I am currently working on Thingy, a social media application. I originally wrote it in [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev), but the weakly typed system was a pain. I am rewriting Thingy in Golang, but I am paying the price for not learning any database other than MongoDB - I hate marshalling JSON.

> I don't really have an up to date portfolio, but the most recently updated one is [here](https://kewlamogh.github.io/portfolio). This is because I've been so busy making stuff that I don't have time to put my projects in my portfolio, so yeah.
